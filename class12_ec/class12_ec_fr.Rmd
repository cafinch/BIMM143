# Population Scale Analysis (Questions 13 & 14)

How many samples do we have?

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs806-ag.txt")
# submission note: the link to the file from the class 12 assignment pdf would not work. I instead had to use the link from the class page 
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch=T)
```
> A14. Higher A content seems to increase gene expression (A|A>A|G>G|G). Therefore, the G|G SNP seems to have a clear association with downregulation of ORMDL3 expression.
